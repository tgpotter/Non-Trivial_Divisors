# Non-Trivial Divisors
A simple program that reads a natural number input by the user and displays all of its divisors in a message dialog box. 

## Directive
Write a program which reads a natural number _n_ and displays in one graphical box all its nontrivial divisors (i.e., from the interval [2, n âˆ’ 1]). If there are no nontrivial divisors, the message should state that the number is prime.
